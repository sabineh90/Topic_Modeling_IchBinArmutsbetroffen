Topic Modeling of the Twitter hashtag #IchBinArmutsbetroffen with LDA in Python

Hello, nice to have you here! My name is Sabine and this is my master thesis project. The title of the thesis is "Being poor in Germany. Topic modeling of the Twitter hashtag #IchBinArmutsbetroffen to determine subjective consequences of poverty". For this purpose, I loaded all tweets (without retweets) for the hashtag #IchBinArmutsbetroffen (including #IchBinArmutbetroffen) from the period 01.05.2022 - 16.12.2022 into a dataset using the Twitter API, cleaned the data and then performed topic modeling with LDA in Python using the Gensim library. 

I am also an open source enthusiast and have learned a lot from the open source community. I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happens through open source, so I want to share my code here as well.
